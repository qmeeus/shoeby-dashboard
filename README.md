to install dependencies:
<br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you want to work on the project, create a new branch:
<br/>
`checkout -b <branch_name>`
<br/>
Then it's as usual, you commit and push, but in the branch, so that it does not conflict with the master project.
To commit from PyCharm:
`ctrl+K` then write a **meaningful** message and `commit (and push)`
<br/>
To commit from CLI:
<br/>
If you created a new file:
<br/>
`git add <filename>`
<br/>
else:
<br/>
`git commit -m <meaningful message>`
<br/>
To push:
<br/>
`git push`
